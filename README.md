Lunchthingtron
==============

Simple Zomato daily menu aggregator built on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) platform, with great help of [electron-boilerplate](https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate).
This is more of a test project for the plaform, so it's very crude.

To run this
* clone the repository: *git clone https://github.com/josefjura/lunchthingtron-electron.git*
* install dependencies: *cd lunchthingtron-electron && npm install*
* set your zomato API key in *config/apiKey.json* to {"key": "YOUR-API-KEY"}
* run with watches: *npm run start*

 
You use this on your own risk, if you burn your computer while running my awesome piece of testcode you are a retard.
